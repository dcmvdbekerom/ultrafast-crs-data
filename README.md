# ultrafast-crs-data

This repository contains the v2 methane Raman cross-sections database required for the [ultrafast-crs](https://github.com/dcmvdbekerom/ultrafast-crs) application.

It is split into separate repositories to facilitate dealing with the large files, and to enable LFS on this repo but not on the application code repo.

You can download this data by running *get_data.py* in the [ultrafast-crs](https://github.com/dcmvdbekerom/ultrafast-crs) repo. Normally there is no reason to download it manually from here.

This database is an extended MeCaSDa database that is curated by the Virtual Atomic and Molecular Data Centre consortium.
